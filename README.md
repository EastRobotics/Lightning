# Lightning
Object-Oriented ROBOTC framework to make programming for VEX Robotics as fast as Lightning.

This software is currently in the very early stages of development and is not yet suitable for competition use.

This framework is written by Michael Hulet ([@raysarebest](https://github.com/raysarebest)) for use on the 2616F "Frightening Lightning" VEX World Championship 2015-participating robot, with the future use by the entire Cherry Hill East Robotics organization in the future.
